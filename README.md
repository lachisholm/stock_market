# Overview

This project is aimed at developing a Real-Time Stock Market Dashboard using Go (Golang). The software provides real-time updates and visualizations of stock market data through a command-line interface (CLI). This project helps further my learning in Go, concurrency, real-time data handling.

The primary purpose of this software is to fetch and display real-time stock data for a given stock symbol using a public API and WebSockets. This project demonstrates how to build a robust CLI application with real-time capabilities and a user-friendly interface.
